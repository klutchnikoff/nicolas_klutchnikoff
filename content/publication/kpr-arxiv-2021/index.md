abstract: It is well known that the classical single linkage algorithm usually fails
  to identify clusters in the presence of outliers. In this paper, we propose a new
  version of this algorithm, and we study its mathematical performances. In particular,
  we establish an oracle type inequality which ensures that our procedure allows to
  recover the clusters with large probability under minimal assumptions on the distribution
  of the outliers. We deduce from this inequality the consistency and some rates of
  convergence of our algorithm for various situations. Performances of our approach
  is also assessed through simulation studies and a comparison with classical clustering
  algorithms on simulated data is also presented.
