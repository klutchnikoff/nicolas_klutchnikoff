abstract: For a Poisson point process X, Itô's famous chaos expansion implies that
  every square integrable regression function r with covariate X can be decomposed
  as a sum of multiple stochastic integrals called chaos. In this paper, we consider
  the case where r can be decomposed as a sum of δ chaos. In the spirit of Cadre and
  Truquet (2015), we introduce a semiparametric estimate of r based on i.i.d. copies
  of the data. We investigate the asymptotic minimax properties of our estimator when
  δ is known. We also propose an adaptive procedure when δ is unknown.
