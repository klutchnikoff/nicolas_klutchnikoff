abstract: This paper focuses on the statistical treatment of illumination artifacts
  on digital images in the presence of an additional random noise. We assume that
  this artifact consists of smooth variations of the intensity of the signal of interest
  R. Such an assumption is classically modelled using a function (L) which acts in
  a multiplicative way on (R). Our goal is to estimate R from observations of a random
  variable Y which obeys the regression model (Y=RL+ɛ). Our main contribution lies
  in the derivation of a new estimator of R which is shown to be consistent under
  suitable identifiability and regularity conditions. The accuracy of this new estimation
  procedure is studied from a theoretical point of view through the rate of convergence
  of the uniform risk. Applications to real Scanning Electron Microscopy images are
  presented, as well as a qualitative study of the performances of our method with
  respect to other image processing techniques.
