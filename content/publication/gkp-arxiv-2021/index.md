abstract: We propose straightforward nonparametric estimators for the mean and the
  covariance functions of functional data. Our setup covers a wide range of practical
  situations. The random trajectories are, not necessarily differentiable, have unknown
  regularity, and are measured with error at discrete design points. The measurement
  error could be heteroscedastic. The design points could be either randomly drawn
  or common for all curves. The definition of our nonparametric estimators depends
  on the local regularity of the stochastic process generating the functional data.
  We first propose a simple estimator of this local regularity which takes strength
  from the replication and regularization features of functional data. Next, we use
  the \"smoothing first, then estimate\" approach for the mean and the covariance
  functions. The new nonparametric estimators achieve optimal rates of convergence.
  They can be applied with both sparsely or densely sampled curves, are easy to calculate
  and to update, and perform well in simulations. Simulations built upon a real data
  example on household power consumption illustrate the effectiveness of the new approach.
