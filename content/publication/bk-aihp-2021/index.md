abstract: This paper deals with estimation with functional covariates. More precisely
  , we aim at estimating the regression function m of a continuous outcome Y against
  a standard Wiener coprocess W. Following Cadre and Truquet (2015) and Cadre, Klutchnikoff,
  and Massiot (2017) the Wiener-Itô decomposition of m(W) is used to construct a family
  of estimators. The minimax rate of convergence over specific smoothness classes
  is obtained. A data-driven selection procedure is defined following the ideas developed
  by Goldenshluger and Lepski (2011). An oracle-type inequality is obtained which
  leads to adaptive results.
