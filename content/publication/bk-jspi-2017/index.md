abstract: 'This paper is devoted to the estimation of the common marginal density
  function of weakly dependent processes. The accuracy of estimation is measured using
  pointwise risks. We propose a datadriven procedure using kernel rules. The bandwidth
  is selected using the approach of Goldenshluger and Lepski and we prove that the
  resulting estimator satisfies an oracle type inequality. The procedure is also proved
  to be adaptive (in a minimax framework) over a scale of Hölder balls for several
  types of dependence: stong mixing processes, $łambda$-dependent processes or i.i.d.
  sequences can be considered using a single procedure of estimation. Some simulations
  illustrate the performance of the proposed method.'
