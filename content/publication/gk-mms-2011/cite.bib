 abstract = {Our aim in this paper is to estimate, with the best possible accuracy, an unknown multidimensional regression function at a given point where the design density is also unknown. To reach this goal, we will follow the minimax approach: it will be assumed that the regression function belongs to a known anisotropic Hölder space. In contrast to the parameters defining the Hölder space, the density of the observations is assumed to be unknown and will be treated as a nuisance parameter. New minimax rates are exhibited as well as local polynomial estimators which achieve these rates. As these estimators depend on a tuning parameter, the problem of its selection is also discussed.},
