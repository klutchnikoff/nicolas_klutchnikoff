abstract: 'Our aim in this paper is to estimate, with the best possible accuracy,
  an unknown multidimensional regression function at a given point where the design
  density is also unknown. To reach this goal, we will follow the minimax approach:
  it will be assumed that the regression function belongs to a known anisotropic Hölder
  space. In contrast to the parameters defining the Hölder space, the density of the
  observations is assumed to be unknown and will be treated as a nuisance parameter.
  New minimax rates are exhibited as well as local polynomial estimators which achieve
  these rates. As these estimators depend on a tuning parameter, the problem of its
  selection is also discussed.'
