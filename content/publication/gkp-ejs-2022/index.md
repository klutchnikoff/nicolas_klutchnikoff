abstract: Combining information both within and across trajectories, we propose a
  simple estimator for the local regularity of the trajectories of a stochastic process.
  Independent trajectories are measured with errors at randomly sampled time points.
  Non-asymptotic bounds for the concentration of the estimator are derived. Given
  the estimate of the local regularity, we build a nearly optimal local polynomial
  smoother from the curves from a new, possibly very large sample of noisy trajectories.
  We derive non-asymptotic pointwise risk bounds uniformly over the new set of curves.
  Our estimates perform well in simulations. Real data sets illustrate the effectiveness
  of the new approaches.
