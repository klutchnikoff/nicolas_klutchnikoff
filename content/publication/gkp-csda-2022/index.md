abstract: We propose a model-based clustering algorithm for a general class of functional
  data for which the components could be curves or images. The random functional data
  realizations could be measured with error at discrete, and possibly random, points
  in the definition domain. The idea is to build a set of binary trees by recursive
  splitting of the observations. The number of groups is determined in a data-driven
  way. The new algorithm provides easily interpretable results and fast predictions
  for online data sets. Results on simulated datasets reveal good performance in various
  complex settings. The methodology is applied to the analysis of vehicle trajectories
  on a German roundabout.
