abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of pointwise estimation in the Gaussian
  white noise model. We propose a new data-driven procedure that achieves (up to a
  multiplicative logarithmic term) the minimax rate of convergence over a scale of
  anisotropic HÃ¶lder spaces. Moreover we present a general criterion in order to define
  what should be an optimal estimation procedure, and we prove that our procedure
  satisfies this criterion. The extra logarithmic factor can thus be viewed as an
  unavoidable price to pay for adaptation.
