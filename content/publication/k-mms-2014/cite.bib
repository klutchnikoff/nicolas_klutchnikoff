 abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of pointwise estimation in the Gaussian white noise model. We propose a new data-driven procedure that achieves (up to a multiplicative logarithmic term) the minimax rate of convergence over a scale of anisotropic HÃ¶lder spaces. Moreover we present a general criterion in order to define what should be an optimal estimation procedure, and we prove that our procedure satisfies this criterion. The extra logarithmic factor can thus be viewed as an unavoidable price to pay for adaptation.},
