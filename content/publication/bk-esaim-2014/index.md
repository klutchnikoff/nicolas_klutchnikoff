abstract: In this paper we are interested in the estimation of a density, defined
  on a compact interval of $mathbf R$,from n independent and identically distributed
  observations. In order to avoid boundary effect, beta kernel estimators are used,
  and we propose a procedure (inspired by Lepski's method) in order to select the
  bandwidth. Our procedure is proved to be adaptive in an asymptotically minimax framework.
  Our estimator is compared with both the cross-validation algorithm and the oracle
  estimator using simulated data.
