abstract: 'In this paper, we are interested in the study of beta kernel density estimators
  from an asymptotic minimax point of view. These estimators allow estimating density
  functions with support in ([0,1]). It is well-known that beta kernel estimators
  are, contrary to classical kernel estimators, free of boundary effect, and thus
  are very useful in practice. The goal of this paper is to prove that there is a
  price to pay: for very regular density functions or for certain losses, these estimators
  are not minimax. Nevertheless they are minimax for classical regularities such as
  regularity of order two or less than two, supposed commonly in the practice and
  for some classical losses.'
