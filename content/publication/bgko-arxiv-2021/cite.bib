 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behavior in $β$-Hölder spaces and under \(L^p\) losses of a Dirichlet kernel density estimator introduced by Aitchison & Lauder (1985) and studied theoretically by Ouimet & Tolosana-Delgado (2021). It is shown that the estimator is minimax when \(p ın [1, 3)$ and $β ın (0, 2]\), and that it is never minimax when \(p ın [4, ınfty)\) or \(β ın (2, ınfty)\). These results rectify in a minor way and, more importantly, extend to all dimensions those already reported in the univariate case by Bertin & Klutchnikoff (2011).},
