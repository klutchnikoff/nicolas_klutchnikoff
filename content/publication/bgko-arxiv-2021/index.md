abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behavior in $β$-Hölder spaces
  and under (L^p) losses of a Dirichlet kernel density estimator introduced by Aitchison
  & Lauder (1985) and studied theoretically by Ouimet & Tolosana-Delgado (2021). It
  is shown that the estimator is minimax when (p ın [1, 3)$ and $β ın (0, 2]), and
  that it is never minimax when (p ın [4, ınfty)) or (β ın (2, ınfty)). These results
  rectify in a minor way and, more importantly, extend to all dimensions those already
  reported in the univariate case by Bertin & Klutchnikoff (2011).
