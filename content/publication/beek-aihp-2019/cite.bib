 abstract = {We study the estimation, in $L^p$-norm, of density functions defined on $[0,1]^d$. We construct a new family of kernel density estimators that do not suer from the so-called boundary bias problem and we propose a data-driven procedure based on the Goldenshluger and Lepski approach that jointly selects a kernel and a bandwidth. We derive two estimators that satisfy oracle-type inequalities. They are also proved to be adaptive over a scale of anisotropic or isotropic Sobolev-Slobodetskii classes (which are particular cases of Besov or Sobolev classical classes). The main interest of the isotropic procedure is to obtain adaptive results without any restriction on the smoothness parameter.},
